As usual in the tech world, the best greeting or introduction to start a new project is the simple and loved hello world. Is enought informal to say well this is almost something but also represents the start of the journey.

So this is my start of the journey, one year ago I decided to move from my birth country and is my plan to away from a while. The reason is more because the world is an amazing place and why not discover what is offering outside of your confort zone?

So the reasons to start a new blog are:

* Write more!
* Talk about the nuts and bolts about implement containers in a real environment 
* And finally just share

So come and enjoy, I have some tea and cookies inside
